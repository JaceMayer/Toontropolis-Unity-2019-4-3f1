# Toontropolis-Unity-2019-4-3f1
TT2 Toontropolis updated to Unity 2019.4.3f1

# Disclosure
This is nowhere near complete, and in some places uses completely different code than what was used in the prototype. Its only includes Toontropolis, not any of the minigames.
This took a long time to get to the point that it was sort of playable. I hope that you all appricate this. With flash player being made EOL, I wanted to help preserve this prototype.

# Things that do work
The keyboard infront of the music shop

Building animations

The power station switching from day to night

Moving

Jump with Space bar

Field Office falls (press escape to do this)

# Things that don't work
The doodle doesn't move

The cogs walk animation is glitchy

The cymbals don't work

Culling is way off

the party cog is broken

When the anvil drops, the wrong sfx is played

The field office doesnt show its animation due to having to recreate its GameObject.
